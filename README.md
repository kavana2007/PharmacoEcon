Main Assumptions:
1. Study population: high-risk group aged 35-59 yrs
2. High risk group already has high blood pressure and has to take medicine:
         one standard dosage = $161
         two standard dosages = $231
3. One standard dosage of anti-hypertension drug can control the SBP to 140 mmHg (conservative trt), while two standard 
   dosage of anti-hypertension drug can control the SBP to 130 mmHg (intensive trt)
3. The anti-hypertension drug has side effects of 0.34
4. Assume drug adherence rate is 75%
5. Discount rate = 3%
